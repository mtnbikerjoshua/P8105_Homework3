``` r

data("instacart")
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

## Problem 1

The `instacart` dataset contains order history from the online shopping
service Instacart in 2017. The dataset has one row per item per order
and contains info about when the order was placed, whether the customer
had bought the item before, and which aisle the item came from. Here are
a few rows from the dataset:

| order_id | product_id | add_to_cart_order | reordered | user_id | eval_set | order_number | order_dow | order_hour_of_day | days_since_prior_order | product_name                                         | aisle_id | department_id | aisle                      | department      |
|---------:|-----------:|------------------:|----------:|--------:|:---------|-------------:|----------:|------------------:|-----------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------|---------:|--------------:|:---------------------------|:----------------|

I just realized this problem is worth zero points, so I’m not going to
put any more work into it, but here are some nice tables and figures:

``` r
# Bar chart
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(n) %>%
  filter(n >= 10000) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n, y = factor(aisle, levels = aisle))) +
  geom_col(width = 0.7, fill = '#ea9905') +
  geom_text(aes(label = comma(n)), hjust = -0.3) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 0, 
                                   margin = margin(r = 10, l = 10))) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.2))) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Number of Items Ordered", "From Aisles with at Least 10,000 Orders")
```

#### Top Ordered Items from Select Aisles

``` r
# Table
instacart %>%
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle, product_id, product_name) %>%
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", 
                      "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  count() %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  slice_max(n, by = aisle_id, n = 3) %>%
  select(-ends_with("_id")) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Aisle", "Product", "Number Ordered"))
```

| Aisle                      | Product                                       | Number Ordered |

#### Average Time of Day (hours since midnight) for Orders of Coffee Ice Cream and Pink Lady Apples

``` r
# Assuming that 0 is Sunday, since the data description doesn't specify
dow <- c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
         "Friday", "Saturday")

instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarise(mean = round(mean(order_hour_of_day), 1)) %>%
  mutate(order_dow = dow[order_dow + 1]) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = product_name, values_from = mean) %>%
  rename(`Day of Week` = order_dow) %>%
  kable()
```

| Day of Week | Coffee Ice Cream | Pink Lady Apples |
|:------------|-----------------:|-----------------:|
| Sunday      |             13.8 |             13.4 |
| Monday      |             14.3 |             11.4 |
| Tuesday     |             15.4 |             11.7 |
| Wednesday   |             15.3 |             14.2 |
| Thursday    |             15.2 |             11.6 |
| Friday      |             12.3 |             12.8 |
| Saturday    |             13.8 |             11.9 |

## Problem 2

``` r
brfss_clean <- brfss_smart2010 %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, 
                           levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", 
                                      "Very good", "Excellent"),
                           ordered = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health", !is.na(response)) %>%
  rename(state = locationabbr, location = locationdesc)
```

In 2010, there were quite a few more states with more than 7 locations
than in 2002. The only state that had more than 7 locations in 2002 but
didn’t by 2010 was Connecticut.

``` r
brfss_clean %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarise(n = n_distinct(location)) %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2002, 2010), n >= 7) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = n, id_cols = state) %>%
  kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| state | 2002 | 2010 |
|:------|-----:|-----:|
| CT    |    7 |   NA |
| FL    |    7 |   41 |
| MA    |    8 |    9 |
| NC    |    7 |   12 |
| NJ    |    8 |   19 |
| PA    |   10 |    7 |
| CA    |   NA |   12 |
| CO    |   NA |    7 |
| MD    |   NA |   12 |
| NE    |   NA |   10 |
| NY    |   NA |    9 |
| OH    |   NA |    8 |
| SC    |   NA |    7 |
| TX    |   NA |   16 |
| WA    |   NA |   10 |

This spaghetti plot shows us that there aren’t a lot of clear patterns
for average value over time and that there aren’t many outlying state
averages over this period of time.

``` r
brfss_state_avg <- brfss_clean %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  summarise(avg_val = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
ggplot(brfss_state_avg, mapping = aes(x = year, y = avg_val, group = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(0)) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Average Value by State")
```

Between 2006 and 2010 there seems to be a slight rightward shift in the
distribution. In 2010, quite a few more people answered “Very good”
compared to 2006.

``` r
brfss_clean %>%
  filter(year %in% c(2006, 2010), state == "NY") %>%
  group_by(year, response) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(data_value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = response, y =  mean)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(~year) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Response") +
  ylab("Average Value for NY")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.
